# SkillSync
SkillSync is a platform where individuals can share their technical skills with others, not for money, but in exchange for learning a new skill themselves. It creates a mutual learning environment where everyone is both a teacher and a learner. This makes tech education more collaborative, inclusive, and cost-free â€” driven by passion, not profit.
